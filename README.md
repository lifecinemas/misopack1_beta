# racepack6_beta

Miso's first racepack map project for the Âµps japro server on JK:JA


CURRENT ISSUE(S):
* ctf_imperial is pretty buggy at the moment. At certain heights/levels and certain angles, the textures disappear.
* The map cannot be compiled without -lomem and -notjunc variables.

LATEST CHANGES:
* Changed the main spawn room entirely from the naboo hangar to ctf_imperial, for players who wish to CTF on the server. The main spawn room is also a course from flag to flag.
* Added rdk-waterfall and j4n_pgb2

Current courses implemented:
* cavernish-noob
* killua-enchie
* helmut-fritz
* helmut-howard
* inder-yegor
* failrun1
* failrun2
* r7-24
* jump5
* pornstar-lamba
* c-mountain
* freerun
* rdk-waterfall
* pgb2
* ctf_imperial



Maps to be planned on adding in the future:
* jump3
* inder-zensn
* df_egypt6
* df_short1

Maps in consideration:

* pornstar-caveman
* flexz-strafe
* tatmt-long1
