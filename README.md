# racepack6_beta

Miso's first racepack map project for the Âµps japro server on JK:JA


CURRENT ISSUE(S):

* The automatic sliding doors on ctf_imperial look pretty ugly, and they also make no noise as well.

LATEST CHANGES:
* Added 'egypt6' course
* Added teleport buttons to return back to main

Current courses implemented:
* cavernish-noob
* killua-enchie
