# racepack6_beta

Miso's first racepack map project for the Âµps japro server on JK:JA


CURRENT ISSUE(S):
* Skyboxes are mashing together and you can see other maps through the skybox.
* The new doors are not as bright as the other ones for some weird reason.

LATEST CHANGES:
* Fixed ctf_imperial's buggyness
* Added short1, zensn, jump3
* Changed the main spawn room entirely from the naboo hangar to ctf_imperial, for players who wish to CTF on the server. The main spawn room is also a course from flag to flag.
* Added rdk-waterfall and j4n_pgb2

Current courses implemented:
* cavernish-noob
* killua-enchie
* helmut-fritz
* helmut-howard
* inder-yegor
* failrun1
* failrun2
* r7-24
* jump5
* pornstar-lamba
* c-mountain
* freerun
* rdk-waterfall
* pgb2
