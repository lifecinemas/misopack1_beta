# racepack6_beta

Miso's first racepack map project for the Âµps japro server on JK:JA


CURRENT ISSUE(S):
* `strangeland` course has a few broken textures, no clue why. Looks glitchy in one specific area of the map. Tried everything I could think of and still no luck. Ignoring this for now.
* `cuddles-9` starting platform is too small. Also, remove the invisible walls, except for the back one.
* The tele doors (zensn, short1, egypt6, cuddles-9) appear to be darker than the rest of the tele doors.
* pk3 file is way too large (70MB+). Need to find a way to reduce filesize. Possibly change texture directories / compress them.

LATEST CHANGES:
* `1/6/2018:`
* Added `strangeland` course
* fixed missing textures in `cuddles-9`. One had to be switched from .tga to .jpg in the shader file, and the other had to be resized to 256x256.
* added `cuddles-9` course
* `1/5/2018:`
* increased light intensity toward the end of `r7-24`.
* removed checkpoint trigger for `ctf_imperial`...was causing timer to just reset.
* fixed `short1` spawn tele...player would become stuck in ground.
* fixed `egypt6` spawn tele...player would spawn outside of map
* patched some missing textures in `ctf_imperial`
* `1/4/2018`
* Fixed the tele doors that were too small
* Removed the elevators and doors in `ctf_imperial` due to invisible ceiling bugs in racemode
* Fixed some triggers that would kill you rather than teleport you back to start
* Fixed waterfalls in `zensn` that were going upward rather than down
* Added cage to start of `failrun1`
* Fixes the purple jello in all courses to make look smooth
* Teleport buttons in courses look fluid
* Added music
* Added levelshot

Maps in consideration:

RANDOM NOTES:
* jump4 is originally called jump3, since there is already a jump3 on RaceArena_Pro, to avoid dftop10 conflictions.
